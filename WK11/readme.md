###### Andy's Feedback
UI issues always tough once you've developed artwork... how to add UI over the work without tacked on... how to embed organically all of this stuff? Input box could be more centre-stage, and more prominent. When i went to click inside the input box, the question changed... this causes a distracting blip in the work. Better if maybe the work serves ONE question (selected from a series) and waits for user response, then you need an elegant way to return to the question page. Long responses don't fit across the browser when the monotone started, -- consider how to line return the text? or use an elipses if over a certain width ("..."). Tech question - styling the text inside the input, requires CSS
