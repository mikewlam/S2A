## MORE FEEDBACK AND CRITIQUES

[Development October 8](https://mikewlam.github.io/S2A/2.project_development/sketch_01_update8_Oct/index.html)

###### Andy's Feedback
- UI development could improve overall work
- Input section could be more prominent to take centre stage and make it unambiguous.
- Need an elegant way to return to the question page.

###### Karen's Feedback
- MONOLOG as a name probably doesn't represent the type of work and foundations that's required to establish RiTa Library
- Potentially something more directly on the idea of mirroring

###### Louis' Feedback
- Sound addition may be unncessary as currently it feels very intrusive.

## Documentation

Last week Andy suggested a way to materialize the final outcome was to start cataloging the series of entries with its respective visual interpretations. I added a saveFrame option and began to collate some visuals of the outcome and then comparing them together. Without the animations, it loses an effect but I think as stills within a collection it creates some interesting disctinctions in form and arranagment.

Few weeks back Louis suggested the potentials of creating an archive of these human and machine interactions and I thought this could become a great extention of the project. Although the main experience of this project is the immersive interactive component, with visual (and hopefully sound). The addition of these collection of outcomes could serve as a dictionary, and a series of form explorations that ultimately become an investigation into a new language. One that's completely generated by nonsense.

## Sound development

I'm still at the point of uncertainty over whether to incorporate sound into the final project. At this stage, I'm not able to refine the monosynth of oscillator to a point that really adds any sort of ambience to the entire experience. I was in agreeance with Louis that the sound that was in the development was very intrusive. I thought an alternative solution could be just to load a mp3 track that provides a sense of ambience, but when experimenting with some synth tracks, I realised the sectioning of the sketch (question, generative visual) meant that the track can't just be played from the start as it would feel quite disconnecting to how the sketch was set up. So at this stage with a few days before presentation, I'll have to leave the sound side as a future expansion of the project and really investigate how I could better utilize the oscillator/monosyth function.
