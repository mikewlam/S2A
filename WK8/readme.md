## PROGRESS IN SESSION

###### SUMMARY

Spending some time this week to briefly run through each of our prototypes and pseudocodes to get a sense of where we're heading in our projects. There's still a lot of loose ends in my idea but I think I mostly need to start experimenting with the sketching out the prototypes to get a sense of whether my thoughts are correct. (From previous week, the runwayML to use vectors from words or the ML5 word2vec library) The big question being how could I extrapolate the data, in this case the vector data, to a comprehensible input that I can input as a variable to my sketch. From what I've seen, the vector information is extension and complicated.. is there a way to average this number? what would this mean in the scope of the project and how can I use this to generate a variable that's suitable to my project?<br/>

###### IN CLASS TUTORIAL

**Speech.js**

Thanks to Shuchen, we were shown an implementation of speechRec library and how to detect speech within a p5js sketch. the speechRec library was quite dynamic and incredibly accurate. I was instantly drawn to the possibilities with this within my project scope and what kind of data I could extrapolate in addition to vector information... or perhaps both? I felt this could be gateway for me to potentially add another element to my project in addition to the variable text display. I am thinking potentially allow users to read the display of the text displayed on the screen, using data from the speech input to generate a variation to the sketch.

## PROTOTYPE IN CODE, ITERATIONS.
