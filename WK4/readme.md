## PROCESSING TUTORIAL ON IMAGE & TYPOGRAPHY

###### Tutorial Summary

Going through the basics of text performance on processing this week. It was a great way to start understanding the foundations of how I can develop my generative project around language and text. This was also a great exercise to wrap my head around the idea of a variable as it was initially confusing to wrap my head around. But having shown the best practice of logically naming the variables make the application of the draw function a little more clear. We also began touching on the randomize function of processing, essentially letting a selction of a random integer within a set sample indicated by random() </br><in the example below with text, we added +1 to remove the possibility of 0></br>

## Project Pitch Development

Been doing a lot of digging and reading during this week's session. Quite honestly the thought of executing a generative system is a little bit daunting. But I feel the way to tackle this is to approach it in bite sizes and build ontop of it. To approach it as a skills endeavour and developing ideas within my practice in a algorithmic and generative format. </br> I'm still toying around the ideas of abstract language and ways we can play with our understanding of language. Something that's always been with me is the idea that language has the ability to represent our reality. [Ted Chiang's *Story of your life*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life) touches on this idea with a science fiction story.</br>

**WORKS THAT TRANSLATE THE IDEAS AROUND LANGUAGE**</br>
###### Allison Parrish - [The Ephemerids](https://twitter.com/the_ephemerides)</br>
This project is a twitter bot that randomly selects images from NASA and pairs it with a computer-generated poem and automatically posts it to Twitter. I was really intrigued by this project because of the type of algorithm that is required to extrapolate a large sample of data automatically and recreates something original for the internet space. Last semester I worked on a project that explores the relationship between printed matter and the post-digital content. In many ways, Allison provides a scope of post-digital content but delivered in a relationship that is purely random and generative. This feels like an extension of something that I was fascinated with from last semester but also a project pathway that allows me to potentially investigate our relationship to technology in a more direct way? </br></br>
Within this generative literature and poem space, I also came across some student works from [Lauren McCarthy's Pedagogy](https://gallery.dma.ucla.edu/filter/159A_2018/rosalindjchang/I-m-Fine) which was a interactive web built on p5js that displays a visual experience of poetry. Something that perhaps could be a final outcome?</br></br>
I was talking about this in class during a small discussion and I was brought to attention of a work by a RISD graduate [Tiger Dingsun](https://tdingsun.github.io/reading-machines/) and struck on the idea of non-teleological reading. Which was quite coincidental as I've been recently reading a book called [SlowReader](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68724434/93014927-71503d80-f5f8-11ea-91d6-9cb9db716d88.jpg).</br> I'm excited at the prospects of potentially investigating the ideas of non-linearity and practicing un-learnings of conventions and ideologies for a genereative project.</br>
As I looked further into Tiger's work, I found an interesting proposition he makes on texts, " Text offers a level of interpretation that seems somehow boundless than images." Each interpretation of text is unique to the person's background, their realities and presents a more unique experience than images.. I thought this was a lovely sentiment and also responds really well to [Tan Lin's 11 minute painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6Y5BLlzNZk) where he presents poetry in a visual and audio format, a purely visceral experience.
