I want to stand back, away from our usual distractions, and question how we make work in the world. I want to start a conversation about design culture. 

So this talk, which is about resistance, is a totally personal account that begins with questions, and a few observations, and ends with some very small gestures. 

It isn't easy, because questioning often leads to ambiguity, or doubt, and that can be uncomfortable. Questioning itself, is a kind of resistance.
