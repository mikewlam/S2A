Spent a lot of time thinking and brainstorming over last week's content. There's been some considerable steps towards refining an idea within the specifics of internet literature and human behaviours. Although at this stage its still very open-ended with no definitive outcome, I think some positives from this ball park is that I can tackle something that I'm personally very interested in exploring as well as developing skills within the web programs, whether it ends up being a site, bot, or an app extension..

Here is a link to [my pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BgXTr32X3XTD2ug8X4fwb3B89VxGWQo5JM76dwsLowI/edit?usp=sharing) to an idea that stems from an inquisition on whether reading is therapeutic. I think this inquiry comes from a bunch of thoughts and queries over the duration of Melbourne's pandemic lockdown as well as the politic climate across the globe, in addition to the exposure to works by Allison Parrish, Lauren McCarthy, Tan Lin and Paul Soullelis.

Tan Lin's work on Ambient Text was really the main intrigue that drove this trail of thought into an idea. Reimagining our understanding of texts has the function that is so similar to the notion of decolonizing our thoughts - through the practice of unlearning and relearning. An interesting question on the ways we can incite the notion of reading seems to allow for a new experience to text and language that keeps away frome knowledge, productivity and subconscious pressure.

###### USEFUL RESOURCES THAT CAN GUIDE THE PROJECT INTO EXISTANCE

1. [Allison Parrish published a github repository to guide through the process of using Python for Text and Data (Scraping)](https://github.com/aparrish/dmep-python-intro)

2. [A github repository on Generative Typography](https://github.com/SpaceTypeContinuum/generative-typography) which may inform the way I produce the final outcome, depending on which direction I end up taking

3. [A guide to text and typography on Javascript](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/text-and-type/)

4. [Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://ml5js.org/)

###### FEEDBACKS ON PITCH

**Jinni Low**

- The potential of generating synthetic images through text, a visual form of story telling. [Link to a reference](https://experiments.runwayml.com/generative_engine/)
- Extending a research direction that reached beyond current projects that touched on the topic of reading. Potentially conceptually similar in the past, without the technology.
