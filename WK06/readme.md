## PROJECT MAPPING

The beginning of this class was opened as a consolidation of everyone's pitch (which were all really amazing). Karen analytical processes guided us to "loosely" categorize our projects into fields of practices which allowed students who share or require similar mediums or data knowledge to discuss collaboratively and share any valuable resources. Although at this stage it was still very vague as to what each of us require in detail, it was good to open up discussion amongst the students and also just generally chat about each other's projects and ideas and where we speculate the final outcome could fall.

I do find these breakout groups to be quite engaging, and I think the culture within this class has by far been the most energetic one. I think having more of these interactions can definitely help formulate a potential with more fluidity and definitely keeps the motivation going..

## PAPER PROTOTYPE EXERCISE

###### SUMMARY

This one is a trip down nostalgia lane! Neo-bomberman is a huge favourite from back in the day. We got to spend a little time to put together paper prototypes as a way to visualize how something can or will work. I've come across this practice within a user experience studio I took last year, so I completely see the value in this exercise for our generative project. Not only does it help formalize our ideas, it may also bring up new possibilities as you see your idea into a scrappy tangible format. Anyway, here's the prototype i made for the neo-bomberman game.
