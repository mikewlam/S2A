Spent a lot of time thinking and brainstorming over last week's content. There's been some considerable steps towards refining an idea within the specifics of internet literature and human behaviours. Although at this stage its still very open-ended with no definitive outcome, I think some positives from this ball park is that I can tackle something that I'm personally very interested in exploring as well as developing skills within the web programs, whether it ends up being a site, bot, or an app extension..</br>

Here is a link to [my pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BgXTr32X3XTD2ug8X4fwb3B89VxGWQo5JM76dwsLowI/edit?usp=sharing) to an idea that stems from an inquisition on whether reading is therapeutic. I think this inquiry comes from a bunch of thoughts and queries over the duration of Melbourne's pandemic lockdown as well as the politic climate across the globe, in addition to the exposure to works by Allison Parrish, Lauren McCarthy, Tan Lin and Paul Soullelis. </br>
