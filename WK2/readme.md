## PROCESSING INTRO, SELF-PORTRAITS AND BRAINSTORMING SYSTEM GENERATED DESIGN

###### 12-hr Challenge

Prior to this week's class, Karen proposed a 12 hour challenge in which we given the task to engage in one of our regular daily activities with algorithmic outcomes. Becoming slaves to our own algorithm. As it was late in the evening by the time I got around to this, I decided to incorporate this challenge to a stretching routine. By compiling (observing) some simple systems or rules that I would usually carry through and assigning each rule to a 6 sided dice, I let chance dictate whether I</br>*A. Switch Light on/off,</br>B. Use Mat or Not,</br>C. Sit down or Standing,</br>D. Body Part, and</br>E. For how long.*</br>

###### Summary
This week was a short but packed introduction to **Processing**, dipping toes into the world of cartesian thinking â€“ processing in terms of coordinates. We're introduced to 



Below are a set of codes being introduced and experimented with:

###### The basic code lines

void setup(){</br>
}</br>
*Set up the canvas for following codes to operate on. Such as Size, Background color*
void draw(){</br>
}</br>
*Anything within the void draw code is a sequence of drawing function that repeats.*
size(width, height);</br>
*Size of canvas
background (R,G,B);</br>
*Background color, in RGB code*

###### Basic Shapes
line (x1,y1,x2,y2);</br>
point (x,y);</br>
rect (topleft, topright, width, height);</br>
ellipse (centreX, centreY, width, height);</br>

###### Shape Style
fill (colour);</br>
noStroke();</br>
stroke (colour);</br>
mouseX ~~> the position of your mouse horizontally </br>
mouseY ~~> the position of your mouse vertically </br>
translate(x,y); //this moves your crosshairs or cartesian reference point</br>
rotate(angle);</br>

###### Condition Parameter
if (mousePressed){
}
else {
}

at the end of our session this week, we went into a quick exercise to discuss some ideas around Input, Output and Process. Some preliminary thoughts on system generated design and perhaps an exercise that will lead to our projects.
