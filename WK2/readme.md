# W2 — 31.08

###### Summary

This week was a short but packed introduction to **Processing**, dipping toes into the world of cartesian thinking – processing in terms of coordinates. We're introduced to 



Below are a set of codes being introduced and experimented with:

###### The basic code lines

>void setup(){</br>
}</br>
*Set up the canvas for following codes to operate on. Such as Size, Background color*
void draw(){</br>
}</br>
*Anything within the void draw code is a sequence of drawing function that repeats.*
size(width, height);</br>
*Size of canvas
background (R,G,B);</br>
*Background color, in RGB code*

###### Basic Shapes
line (x1,y1,x2,y2);</br>
point (x,y);</br>
rect (topleft, topright, width, height);</br>
ellipse (centreX, centreY, width, height);</br>

###### Shape Style
fill (colour);</br>
noStroke();</br>
stroke (colour);</br>
mouseX ~~> the position of your mouse horizontally </br>
mouseY ~~> the position of your mouse vertically </br>
translate(x,y); //this moves your crosshairs or cartesian reference point</br>
rotate(angle);</br>

###### Condition Parameter
if (mousePressed){
}
else {
}
