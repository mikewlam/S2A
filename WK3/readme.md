## (W3) OFFGRID SESSION AND PITCH INTRODUCTION

###### Summary
We kicked off this week's session with an offgrid exercise which was super refreshing given the lockdown restrictions here in Melbourne going in full force for the first week (again). After seeing works from some various artists that demonstrate examples of rules-based design, we begin to explore the concept of *non human collaboration*. Essentially a system that defers agency and allows for an outcome that is only partially human influenced. We began by sketching ideas of objects and locations in our surrounding environment that could allow for us to create a drawing machine that isn't driven by conventional motions of drawing (ie. finger, wrist and arm movement)

Coincidently in Semester 1 of 2019, For my studio assignment I designed and built a drawing mechanism that marks the movements of my body.<br /> This is the only picture I could find on my current machine.
