## OFFGRID SESSION ON [HUMAN MACHINE COLLABORATION] 

###### Summary
We kicked off this week's session with an offgrid exercise which was super refreshing given the lockdown restrictions here in Melbourne going in full force for the first week (again). After seeing works from some various artists that demonstrate examples of rules-based design, we begin to explore the concept of *non human collaboration*. Essentially a system that defers agency and allows for an outcome that is only partially human influenced. We began by sketching ideas of objects and locations in our surrounding environment that could allow for us to create a drawing machine that isn't driven by conventional motions of drawing (ie. finger, wrist and arm movement)

Coincidently in Semester 1 of 2019, For my studio assignment I designed and built a drawing mechanism that marks the movements of my body.<br /> This is the only picture I could find on my current machine.<br />

## INTRODUCTION TO PITCH REQUIREMENTS
As a preliminary speculation of our final project for this studio, we're tasked to consolidated our exposures to generative design, art and works within this field, and various learnings and readings to structure a possible project and pitch it within a 5 minute pecha kucha presentation.</br>
**10 slides, 30s each, 5min in total**</br>
Doesn't seem to be a big presentation and probably requires a huge effort in articulating the proposal in a short period of time but i think this would be a great point to start formalizing a final project.. even though the pitch doesn't neccessarily need to inform the final project.</br>
During class time, Andy dropped a lot of wisdom. One specific point he meant was a distinction between a designer who solves problems and a designer who seeks problems... to solve. There was a lot about this that resonated with me especially as I reflect back onto my previous projects and the ways in which I approach each one, as well as moments where I come across ideas or projects and the responses I have to it. I definitely seek problems to solve, constantly trying to take things a step further..</br> Andy's comment was made as an advice for us to conceptualize our project with. Focusing less on the **what** and more on the **how** and especially on the **why**.</br>
###### Speculate a system of experimental method that can generate design.</br>
lots of thinking to do..</br>

###### Generative Work Research

Over the week, I across the works of Jannis Maroscheck on his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jannimaroscheck/) and was intrigued by one of early projects on abstract language, so i reached out to ask about this project. He's response:<br/>

>in the first paragraph of shape grammars i am writing about this project: In 2017, in my third semester, I designed my first Shape Grammar, more or less accidentally, without knowing the term for it yet. The principle of this work was simple.
There are three dices. Each of these dices is based on a geometric figure: a circle, a square or two crossing diagonals ( X ). The six sides of the dices show fragments of these figures, for example a semicircle, an edge of a square, a piece of a diagonal. The next step is to throw the dice. If you now draw the diced fragments on top of each other, forms are created that are reminiscent of unknown characters, of hieroglyphics.
This system functions as an analogous program, as a primitive design machine. Instead of using actual dice, the program can also be run by a computer. The algorithm can be described as follows: Choose three random fragments of circle, square and diagonal, rotate them randomly in 90 degree steps, assemble the fragments into a the fragments into a shape. This way, several thousand individual combinations can be designed in a few seconds and saved as vector files.
This idea of mass production of forms has been stuck in my head. for this project i used the generated signs as a language for randomly generated tellings about the future. i made a small dictionary for all the fragments of circle (noun), square(adjective) and diagonal(verb). because i had the basic geometric shapes, i tried to use the "basic" words. for example the full circle would mean "world", or the upwards diagonal "growing". this way each sign would be one randomly generated sentence with this syntax: The ADJ NOUN will VERB.

I think there's something really interesting about works surrounding language and how we can visually represent this in abstract forms. With the element of algorithmic generation based a parametric system, it raises the question of whether we can create new set of languages that extends more universal? Could we then begin to think about language without biases and also cultural interventions? Will there still be poetry? What if language was just visual stripped away from any meaning..
