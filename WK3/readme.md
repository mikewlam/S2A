## OFFGRID SESSION ON [HUMAN MACHINE COLLABORATION] AND INTRODUCTION TO PITCH REQUIREMENTS

###### Summary
We kicked off this week's session with an offgrid exercise which was super refreshing given the lockdown restrictions here in Melbourne going in full force for the first week (again). After seeing works from some various artists that demonstrate examples of rules-based design, we begin to explore the concept of *non human collaboration*. Essentially a system that defers agency and allows for an outcome that is only partially human influenced. We began by sketching ideas of objects and locations in our surrounding environment that could allow for us to create a drawing machine that isn't driven by conventional motions of drawing (ie. finger, wrist and arm movement)

Coincidently in Semester 1 of 2019, For my studio assignment I designed and built a drawing mechanism that marks the movements of my body.<br /> This is the only picture I could find on my current machine.<br />

###### Generative Work Research

Over the week, I came across a designer by the name Jannis Maroscheck. I saw a work of his on his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jannimaroscheck/) and was intrigued by one of his generative language work, so i reached out to ask about this project. He's response:<br/>

>in the first paragraph of shape grammars i am writing about this project: In 2017, in my third semester, I designed my first Shape Grammar, more or less accidentally, without knowing the term for it yet. The principle of this work was simple.
There are three dices. Each of these dices is based on a geometric figure: a circle, a square or two crossing diagonals ( X ). The six sides of the dices show fragments of these figures, for example a semicircle, an edge of a square, a piece of a diagonal. The next step is to throw the dice. If you now draw the diced fragments on top of each other, forms are created that are reminiscent of unknown characters, of hieroglyphics.
This system functions as an analogous program, as a primitive design machine. Instead of using actual dice, the program can also be run by a computer. The algorithm can be described as follows: Choose three random fragments of circle, square and diagonal, rotate them randomly in 90 degree steps, assemble the fragments into a the fragments into a shape. This way, several thousand individual combinations can be designed in a few seconds and saved as vector files.
This idea of mass production of forms has been stuck in my head. for this project i used the generated signs as a language for randomly generated tellings about the future. i made a small dictionary for all the fragments of circle (noun), square(adjective) and diagonal(verb). because i had the basic geometric shapes, i tried to use the "basic" words. for example the full circle would mean "world", or the upwards diagonal "growing". this way each sign would be one randomly generated sentence with this syntax: The ADJ NOUN will VERB.

What intrigued me about this project was this intention to generate a set of language through a system allocated to parts of grammar that we can recognize.
